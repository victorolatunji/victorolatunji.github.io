        <h2>The trouble with Bears<h2>
       <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>

    <p>Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.</p>

    <p>So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.</p>

    <h3>Types of bear</h3>
    <p>Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was probably a cub from another species.</p>

    <p>Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behaviour however, as you'll find out below. The table below also gives you some useful facts about bears.</p>

        <table>
          <caption>Comparison of wild and urban bears by coat, size, habitat, lifespan, and diet.</caption>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">Bear Type</th>
                <th scope="col">Coat</th>
                <th scope="col">Adult size</th>
                <th scope="col">Habitat</th>
                <th scope="col">Lifespan</th>
                <th scope="col">Diet</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td>Wild</td>
                <td>Brown or black</td>
                <td>1.4 to 2.8 meters</td>
                <td>Woods and forests</td>
                <td>25 to 28 years</td>
                <td>Fish, meat, plants</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Urban</td>
                <td>North Face</td>
                <td>1.8 to 2.2 meters</td>
                <td>Condos and coffee shops</td>
                <td>20 to 32 years</td>
                <td>Starbucks, sushi</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
        <p>Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. They usually hunt for food in woodland or rivers, but may scavenge from farms or country houses. They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.</p>

        <p>Urban (gentrified) bears have largely abandoned the old ways. They may hunt other urban creatures, but often scavenge from dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints. Some have been known to break into kitchens to steal essentials like baked beans, ready meals, and microwave ovens.</p>

        <p>Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks, to fast-food restaurant toilets, to their own apartments.</p>

        <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
        <p>Bears are romantic creatures by nature, seeking lifelong partners. Wild bears may decorate their dwellings with cave paintings or reeds; urban bears might opt for mood lighting and a Michael Bublé CD.</p>

        <p>The following audio clip contains more details about bear mating rituals:</p>
